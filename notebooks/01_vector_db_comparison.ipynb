    "\n",
    "1. **Metadata Filtering**: Fondamentale per l'obiettivo del nostro progetto\n",
    "   - Filtrare per categoria (Education, Gaming, etc.)\n",
    "   - Filtrare per canale\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Persistenza Integrata**: Salva automaticamente su disco\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scala del Progetto**: Con ~10K video, la differenza di performance è trascurabile\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semplicità**: API più pulita, meno codice da mantenere\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Documenti + Embeddings**: Possiamo salvare il testo originale insieme al vettore\n"
